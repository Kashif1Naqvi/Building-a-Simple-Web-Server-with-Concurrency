# Setting Up Rust

To install Rust and set up your environment to run Rust programs, follow these steps:

## 1. Install Rust
Rust provides an official installer called `rustup`. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

## 2. Configure Your Environment
After installation, ensure that the Rust binaries are added to your `PATH`. Restart your terminal or run:

```bash
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

## 3. Verify Installation
Check if Rust is installed correctly by running:

```bash
rustc --version
```

This should display the installed Rust version.

## 4. Install a Code Editor (Optional)
Install a code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and add the [Rust Analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) extension for better development experience.

## 5. Write and Run a Rust Program
Create a new Rust project using Cargo (Rust's package manager):

```bash
cargo new hello_world
cd hello_world
```

Run the program:

```bash
cargo run
```

You're now ready to develop in Rust!
